# Autonomous Code Improver

An autonomous, multi-agent system for code improvement that ingests Git repositories, builds knowledge graphs, performs static and dynamic analysis, suggests and implements features, verifies with tests, and opens pull requests.

## Features

- **Repository Ingestion**: Clone and index Git repositories
- **Code Parsing**: Parse code into abstract syntax trees (AST) using Tree-sitter
- **Knowledge Graph**: Build and query a Neo4j knowledge graph of code relationships
- **Static Analysis**: Detect bugs, security issues, and code smells with tools like Ruff, Bandit, and ESLint
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Run tests and benchmarks to identify runtime issues
- **Mutation Testing**: Evaluate test suite effectiveness with mutation testing
- **Feature Discovery**: Use LLMs to discover and propose new features
- **Refactoring**: Plan and apply code improvements
- **Verification**: Test changes and generate risk reports
- **Pull Requests**: Automatically create PRs with improvements
- **Learning**: Store and learn from historical outcomes

## Architecture

The system consists of multiple specialized agents:

- **Ingestion Agent**: Clones and indexes repositories
- **Analysis Agent**: Performs static and dynamic analysis
- **Graph Agent**: Manages the knowledge graph
- **Innovator Agent**: Discovers and proposes new features
- **Modifier Agent**: Plans and applies code changes
- **Verifier Agent**: Tests and validates changes
- **PR Agent**: Creates and manages pull requests
- **Memory Agent**: Stores and learns from historical data
